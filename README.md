# Copernicus_Extractor
Copernicus_Extractor is my final year project as part of my Computer Science & Software Engineering Degree (Maynooth University).

## Purpose  
This tool can be used to extract air quality data published by the Copernicus Satellite.

The tool leverages the __wgrib2__ tool to help extract data from the grib file published by the satellite.

## End goal
By the end of the project, this tool will be able to be used to extract and perform analysis on air quality data and can be used along side existing, on-site air quality monitors for data verification.
